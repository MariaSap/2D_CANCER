### Memory Issues
- Reduce batch size for GPU memory constraints
- Use gradient accumulation for effective larger batches
- Consider mixed precision training (`torch.cuda.amp`)

### Training Stability
- Monitor D/G loss balance
- Adjust learning rate ratio if one dominates
- Increase R1 penalty if discriminator overfits
